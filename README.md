# UBA-Market-Analysis
This data analysis project analyzes the results of a market survey carried out to test the reception of a newly proposed product by UBA (a financial institution). The analysis starts by examining the demographics of the survey respondents, and then a breakdown of how the product was received was presented on later pages of the dashboard. This analysis helps the strategy team decide the next course of action regarding the proposed product and also gives the marketing team insight into key features customers might be interested in.
